# Upgrading

## 10.0.0

### Version 10 is a major internal rewrite

- All API resources have been removed
- All resources have been refactored around an abstracted common base resource `_config_file`
  - LDAP resources extend this via `_config_file_ldap`
- Resource properties are automatically enumerated and added to the accumulator configuration file
- The accumulator templates for the configuration files are now persistent via the loading of the current config state during creation
  - Configuration is no longer automatically removed when the resource falls out of scope
  - To remove configuration elements an explicit resource with `:delete` action is required
    - If no properties are specified with the `:delete` action then the whole configuration section will be removed
    - If properties are specified with the `:delete` action then only the specified properties will be removed
  - Configuration files will not be overwritten with a blank or partial configuration when a run fails
- The auth resource has been split into separate resources
- The log resource has been split into separate resources
- The LDAP configuration resource has been split and renamed to singular forms

## 9.0.0

Ensure you are on chef 15.5 or greater as we are now using `chef_sleep` in tests

## 8.0.0

ensure your `instance_name` (Name property) lines up across all `grafana_config_*` and `grafana_config` resources
Remove any resources of type `service` of `grafana-server`
Remove any `source`, `cookbook`, `config_file` and `config_directory` overrides from all `grafana_config_*` resources
Remove any `cookbook` and `config_directory` overrides from the `grafana_config` resource
Add the `grafana_config_writer` to the end of your config resources, this will create the config file on disk and restart grafana to allow any api calls to work straight after
Change `ldap_config_servers` `host` property from the name property to a normal property (required)
Change `ldap_config_group_mappings` `group_dn` property from the name property to a normal property (required)
Added `instance_name` to above resources as name property, this should line up across all config resources
Change `grafana_config_database` property `type` to a symbol
Change `grafana_config_database` property `ssl_mode` to a symbol or true/false
Change `grafana_config_remote_cache` property `remote_cache_type` to a symbol
Change `grafana_config_server` property `protocol` to a symbol
Change `grafana_config_session` property `session_provider` to a symbol
Change `grafana_config` property `restart_on_upgrade` to `true` or `false`

## 7.0.0

Create a resource for `service` of `grafana-server` and subscribe to changes to config files

```ruby
service 'grafana-server' do
  action [:enable, :start]
  subscribes :restart, ['template[/etc/grafana/grafana.ini]', 'template[/etc/grafana/ldap.toml]'], :delayed
end
```

## 6.0.0

Resource `grafana_config_ldap_servers` has had the property `group_search_base_dns` changed to an Array

## 5.0.0

Fixes an issue where the `database_name` property on `config_database` was not being taken, this has now been resolved and will default to `grafana` from now on.

## 4.0.0

This cookbook has changed to resource driven configuration and you will need to migrate to these resources
